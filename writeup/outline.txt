5. Results

    5.1. Model evaluation

    We evaluate models on a cross-validated seed word classification task.
    Explain task and all three levels.

    Include table summarizing all results.

    For the rest of the analysis, we stick to centroid model (simplest and
    has competitive results).

    5.2. Moral sentiment prediction (PEW)

    TODO.

    5.3. Moral sentiment change

    We apply framework to detecting change of moral sentiment over time in
    three ways: 1) analyzing selected historically relevant concepts;
    2) automatically detecting concepts predicted to have undergone sharpest
    change in moral sentiment over the past two centuries; and 3) comparing
    the predicted overall velocity of moral sentiment change in different
    historical periods.

        5.3.1. Probe concepts

        We show time courses exploring moral sentiment toward historically
        relevant topics in three levels: moral relevance, polarity, and
        fine-grained moral categories.

        Figures A-B show these historical trends for concepts (e.g.)
        _gay_, _democracy_, and _slavery_. These show how a concept can
        become morally relevant (gay, mention semantic change); undergo a
        shift toward negative (slavery) or positive (democracy) moral sentiment;
        or become predominantly alignment with different moral categories
        over time (explain slavery and democracy).

        5.3.2. Automated extraction

        Beyond analyzing selected concepts, we can apply the framework in a
        predictive setting to automatically discover moral sentiment change
        patterns.

        Describe top-k extraction in three levels from top 5000 nouns.

        Show results.

        5.3.3. Rate of change over history

        (Do we have results for this section, or plan to include it for sure?)
