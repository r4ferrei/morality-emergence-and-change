Moral sentiment is the attitude of praise or blame that people exhibit toward
a concept or event. The inquiry of moral sentiment has traditionally been
pursued in philosophy, with later extensions to social psychology, and more
recent developments in natural language processing and computational social
science. Despite this extensive line of research, formal approaches to moral
sentiment change -- how people's moral sentiments shift over time -- are still
in their infancy. We present a computational approach for investigating moral
sentiment change via large-scale analysis of longitudinal text corpora. We
construct moral environment over time by exploiting implicit moral biases
learned from diachronic word embeddings, and demonstrate how a parameter-free
categorization model supports inference of historical shifts in moral sentiment
of the public toward concepts such as _slavery_ and _democracy_ on three levels:
moral relevance, moral polarity, and fine-grained moral categories. We
demonstrate the potential of this methodology for large-scale studies of moral
sentiment change with an investigation of the effect of linguistic and
psychological variables on historical shifts in moral sentiment. Our work
provides opportunities for preemptive detection of moral sentiment change in
society.
